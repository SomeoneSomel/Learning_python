some files of me learning python or some other language idk im too lazy to make a good repository sorry. also, most of the things in this repo is on portuguese, so if you are a citizen of the freedom country, you maybe will need google translate. sorry if this repository lacks formality, im really bad in being formal, probably one day i will make this a formal repo and make it not suck (also, sorry marcus if this readme is bad and my account doesnt have my profile pic, im trying, and also shy)
